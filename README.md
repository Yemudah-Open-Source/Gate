### Features of Switch Tool:

1. **Real-time Session Tracking**: 
   - Track active user sessions in real-time and know exactly what page each user is currently on.
   - Display session details including session ID and active page on a central dashboard.

2. **Instant Session Updates with SSE**: 
   - Using Server-Sent Events (SSE), Switch ensures that all active sessions are updated instantly. When a session's page changes, all connected clients are notified in real-time without needing to refresh.
   - This allows admins to monitor user actions without the need for manual checks.

3. **Session Timeout Management**:
   - Define custom timeouts for each session to track inactive users. If a user doesn’t interact within the specified timeout, their session will be automatically removed.
   - Prevents unnecessary resource usage by handling inactive sessions efficiently.

4. **Customizable Session Timeout**:
   - Configure session timeout values based on user or session preferences, allowing for flexibility in how long sessions remain active.
   - Helps in managing different session durations for different types of users or activities.

5. **Detailed Admin Dashboard**:
   - View a live list of all active sessions, including session ID and page.
   - Monitor and control user activities efficiently from a single, intuitive interface.

6. **SSE Notifications**:
   - Admins receive instant notifications about session updates (page changes, timeouts).
   - Can handle hundreds of sessions at once, ensuring scalability and performance.

7. **CORS Support**:
   - Seamlessly integrates with your frontend using CORS support, allowing easy connection from different domains, especially useful for Single Page Applications (SPAs).

8. **Backend Integration**:
   - Easy to integrate with your existing backend infrastructure.
   - Supports active session tracking without requiring manual intervention or polling.

### Benefits of Using Switch Tool:

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Admins and developers get immediate insights into active user sessions. No need to refresh or manually check the system—everything updates in real-time.
   - Enables quick decision-making based on user behavior.

2. **Improved User Experience**:
   - By monitoring active sessions and the pages users are on, admins can identify user patterns and issues more quickly, leading to a more responsive support system.
   - Proactively address any issues with user sessions without relying on reports or logs.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Designed to handle a large number of concurrent sessions, making it suitable for applications with high user traffic.
   - With SSE and real-time updates, performance remains optimal even with hundreds or thousands of active sessions.

4. **Efficient Resource Management**:
   - Automatically removes inactive sessions, preventing wasted resources on users who are no longer active.
   - The configurable session timeout feature ensures that inactive users don't unnecessarily tie up system resources.

5. **Simplified Admin Operations**:
   - With the ability to track and update sessions dynamically, the Switch tool simplifies the complexity of manual session management.
   - Automated notifications reduce the need for admins to constantly check sessions.

6. **Flexibility**:
   - Customizable settings for session timeouts, SSE events, and more, ensuring that Switch can meet the needs of different types of projects.
   - Suitable for applications that require real-time user tracking, including admin dashboards, user activity monitoring, and more.

7. **Easy Integration**:
   - With built-in support for SSE and CORS, Switch integrates smoothly with your frontend, making it easy to get started without complex configurations.
   - The backend is lightweight and integrates seamlessly with existing server-side technologies.

8. **Enhanced Security**:
   - By tracking active sessions and removing stale sessions automatically, Switch helps to ensure that only active users have access to sensitive data or features.
